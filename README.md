# SPARQL with hobbits :woman_farmer: :farmer: :tomato: :mage_man:	 	

# Project setup  
This project requires access to:  
+ A [Stardog cloud](https://www.stardog.com/stardog-cloud/) free tier account.
+ The Visual Studio [`stardog-rdf-grammars`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stardog-union.stardog-rdf-grammars) extension, which is also hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/stardog-union/stardog-vsc/tree/master/stardog-rdf-grammars).   

# Scenario  
## Mapping Hobbiton's food supply chains    
Food is inarguably the most important resource in Hobbiton. Goods are arguably assigned to either the agriculture, retail trade, wholesale trade, food services, transport or recreation industry, depending on which hobbit economist is doing the arguing.  

To map these complexities and resolve subject matter in-fighting, we can represent Hobbiton's food supply chains using a knowledge graph. 

## Datasets   
The following datasets are collected in Hobbiton and stored in `./data/raw_data`:  
+ `farming.csv` - contains the date, farmer, product and count of vegetable produce.  
+ `shops_register.csv` - contains the date, Shire business ID, trading name, shop owner and trading status of all businesses within the Shire (the region that Hobbiton belongs to).   
+ `general_store.csv` - contains the date, product and number of items sold at the Hobbiton general store.
